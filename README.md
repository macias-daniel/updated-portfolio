Updating portfolio to demostrate the knowdledge ive gained as a webdeveloper

## Summary
I have now been coding full time for about 3 months now. One of the very first projects I did was to create a portfolio for future projects. Now that i am a more expirienced
web developer I decided to take a crack at updating my old portfolio. I am happy with the way it turned out. I ended up using a brand new framework (UIkit) which which was a chanllenge because I was so used to Bootstrap, but it was a good challenge none the less. I hope you like it as much as I did!
